Left our land on ship owned by one of Myrddin's many cousins.
Tasked with finding food on island for the ship's crew.
Landed on shore near empty camp.  Found a bunch of loot.
Killed 8 tarantulas at camp.  Ivellios was fairly useless.
Followed dragged-feet tracks.
Battled three Giant Wolf Spiders.  Ivellios saved the day using both level 1 slots with Thunderwave.
Followed secondary tracks back to goblin village, discovering Lark(?).  Lark hated "evil small ones" and "8-legged demons."
 - "Oh man.  We have to fight spiders AND 8-legged demons?" --Everan
Lark agreed to come with us to rescue his village.
Followed tracks into spider nest.  Goblins and halflings hanging in spider-spun cocoons.
Fought Ettercap (humanoid spider dude).  Lark crit for 12 on first turn.
Halflings all dead.  Several goblins rescued.
Escort goblins back to their village.  Goblins award us food which we bring back to ship.
Shipmates happy during storm.
Arrive at Lisrim's Landing; stay at The White Cup inn, run by Piersym Braham, at the suggestion of the ship's captain.
Lots of quest options.
 - Orange Company (mercenary group?) with 6-month contract.  5gp/day = 900gp/6 months + presumably some amount of loot.  Would probably be enough to pay Myrddin's debt off at end of contract.
 - Crystal Heralds (Karmacy Elves) Diamond division wants larger presence (permanent base) on Tenebris.
   - Karmacy Elf recognizes Myrddin as the dwarf who fought off the 'black enchantress' having to leave his jerkin behind in his escape.  Jerkin now permanently affixed to the Lewwater Inn, and Myrddin regarded as local legend.  Elf wins bet with friend.
 - Jawbone bounty?  (I missed something, I think.)
 - Guy looking for old maps, wishing to recover 200-year-old history.
 - Slateback Prospectors Guild searching for Aurorian mine near Aofie's Stand.
